# **microcomputer-programming**

 **The project involves the code for my Microcomputer Systems and Interface Laboratory experiments, primarily using assembly language. Each experiment is divided into a fundamental experiment and some advanced experiments.** 

- ### Experiment 1
  
Write a basic input-output program in assembly language to configure the 8255 chip. Set Port A as input and Port B as output. Achieve data transfer from the toggle switches to the data LEDs. The requirement is for the data LEDs to display data dynamically as the switches are toggled.

 - Extension

(1) Enhance the basic experiment with the following functionality: If switches K7 to K0 are all in the high state, the program should exit.

(2) Write a program to achieve the following functionality: When K0 is in the high state, the upper 4 bits of the data LEDs are illuminated; when K0 is in the low state, the lower 4 bits of the data LEDs are illuminated.

(3) Develop a program to accomplish the following tasks: When K1K0=00, all data LEDs should be turned off; when K1K0=01, the lower 4 bits of the data LEDs should be illuminated; when K1K0=10, the upper 4 bits of the data LEDs should be illuminated; when K1K0=11, all data LEDs should be turned on.
